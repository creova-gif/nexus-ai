## 1. Executive Summary

NexusAI is a production-grade, AI-powered Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance platform purpose-built for Canadian financial institutions. It replaces fragmented, manual compliance workflows with a unified intelligent system that monitors transactions, triages alerts, generates regulatory filings, and orchestrates AI-driven investigations — all from a single workspace.

The platform is designed to help compliance teams at banks, credit unions, fintechs, and federal regulators meet their FINTRAC, OSFI, and PCMLTFA obligations with dramatically less manual effort, fewer false positives, and a complete, auditable record of every decision.

**Core value proposition:** Reduce AML alert review time by 70%, SAR drafting time by 85%, and false positive rates by 40% — without sacrificing regulatory defensibility.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Reality

Canadian financial institutions collectively review millions of AML alerts per year. The process is:

- **Slow:** A single alert investigation takes an analyst 45–90 minutes on average, involving manual lookups across multiple systems
- **Inaccurate:** Industry false positive rates run 95–99%, meaning analysts spend most of their time on non-issues
- **Fragmented:** Transaction monitoring, entity screening, SAR filing, and audit logging happen in separate, disconnected systems
- **Expensive:** A mid-size bank's compliance team costs $2–8M annually; headcount grows linearly with alert volume
- **Regulatory risk:** Manual processes create gaps — missed filings, inconsistent documentation, and audit trails that can't withstand regulatory scrutiny

### The Consequence

FINTRAC levied $7.4M in penalties against Canadian FIs in 2023–24. OSFI's enhanced supervisory framework now requires real-time evidence of effective transaction monitoring controls. The cost of non-compliance — financial, reputational, and operational — has never been higher.

### The Gap

Existing solutions (Actimize, NICE, Oracle FCCM) were built in a pre-AI era. They require 12–18 month implementation timelines, large IT teams to maintain, and produce alert queues that still require extensive manual review. No Canadian-native solution exists that integrates AI inference, RAG-based investigation, FINTRAC filing, and complete audit trail in a single platform with Canada-first data residency.

---

## 3. Product Vision & Strategy

### Vision

> "NexusAI makes every compliance team act like they have ten times the people — by making AI the first analyst, not the last resort."

### Strategic Positioning

NexusAI is **not** a rules engine replacement. It sits on top of existing transaction monitoring infrastructure, ingesting alerts and enriching them with AI analysis, entity graph data, regulatory knowledge, and investigator memory. It is the layer that connects raw alerts to defensible regulatory outcomes.

### Strategic Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Canada-first** | Data never leaves Canada by default. Pre-loaded PCMLTFA thresholds, FINTRAC form types, OSFI guidance |
| **AI-native** | Every workflow is augmented by AI — not bolted on. Models are routed, fallback-chained, and upgraded transparently |
| **Audit-defensible** | Every AI decision is explainable, every human action is logged, and the full chain is tamper-evident |
| **Workspace isolation** | Complete data, encryption, and inference isolation per tenant — no cross-institutional data exposure |
| **Open by design** | REST API, webhooks, and SSO mean NexusAI fits into existing workflows rather than replacing them |

---

## 4. Target Market & Users

### Primary Market

**Tier 1:** Big Six Canadian banks (RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC, NBC) — 500+ compliance staff, complex multi-jurisdiction AML programs, $10M+ annual compliance spend

**Tier 2:** Mid-size banks, credit unions, mortgage companies, insurance companies — 50–200 compliance staff, OSFI-regulated, FINTRAC reporting entities

**Tier 3:** Fintechs, money service businesses (MSBs), crypto platforms, payment processors — small compliance teams (2–20), rapid growth, FINTRAC-registered

**Tier 4 (Government):** FINTRAC, OSFI, Bank of Canada, provincial securities regulators — internal analytical use, cross-institutional data analysis, regulatory oversight

### User Personas

---

#### Persona 1 — Sarah, Chief Compliance Officer
**Institution:** Mid-size Canadian bank (5,000 employees)
**Age:** 48 | **Experience:** 20+ years in compliance

**Goals:**
- Demonstrate to OSFI that the AML program is effective and improving
- Reduce team burnout from high alert volumes
- Shorten time-to-file on SARs to stay within regulatory deadlines
- Have a defensible audit trail for every decision

**Pain Points:**
- Manually reviewing dashboards from 5 different systems every morning
- Difficulty explaining to regulators why certain alerts were closed
- Fear of a FINTRAC penalty due to a missed SAR
- Budget pressure to do more with fewer headcount additions

**How NexusAI helps:** Executive dashboard showing real-time compliance posture, AI-generated risk narrative for every alert, SAR approval workflow with full AI attribution, immutable audit export for regulatory exams

---

## 10. Compliance & Regulatory Requirements

### PCMLTFA (Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act)

- All STR, LCTR, and EFTR reports generated in NexusAI must meet FINTRAC's prescribed form and content requirements
- Platform must enforce mandatory reporting deadlines (STR: as soon as practicable; LCTR: 15 days; EFTR: 5 business days)
- Customer identification and verification records must be retained for 5 years after last business relationship
- NexusAI does not replace the obligation of the reporting entity — it is a tool to help them meet their obligations

### OSFI B-10 (Third-Party Risk Management)

- NexusAI must provide contractual commitments covering: data access controls, audit rights, incident notification (within 72h), business continuity, and data return/destruction
- Target only, after a certification that has not been obtained: an annual service organization control report could be shared with customers. None exists today.
- Customers can conduct their own due diligence assessments (security questionnaire, site visit for Enterprise)

### OSFI B-8 (Operational Resilience)

- Platform's RTO and RPO commitments documented and tested quarterly
- DR drill results shared with Enterprise customers annually
- Incident response runbook provided to customers

### PIPEDA / Privacy Act

- All data processing documented in a ROPA (Record of Processing Activities)
- Data processing agreements (DPA) signed with all third-party subprocessors (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS, Pinecone)
- Cross-border data transfer assessments conducted for any non-Canadian subprocessor
- Privacy officer designated; contact information published in privacy policy

## 12. Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for the initial product:

- **Transaction monitoring engine:** NexusAI ingests alerts from existing TM systems (Actimize, Oracle) but does not replace them. Building a proprietary TM engine is v2+.
- **Core banking integration:** NexusAI does not connect directly to core banking ledgers for real-time transaction feeds in v1. Alert-level integration only.
- **Customer-facing portal:** NexusAI is a compliance team tool. A customer portal for entities to submit KYC documents directly is v2+.
- **Mobile native app:** Dashboard is responsive web. Native iOS/Android apps are v2+.
- **Multi-language support:** English only in v1. French (Canada official language) in v2.
- **US FINCEN / FinCEN integration:** FINTRAC Canada only in v1. US reporting in v3+.
- **EU AMLD-6 compliance:** EU regulatory framework support in v3+.
- **Real-time transaction scoring:** Sub-second transaction-level scoring is a future ML pipeline feature, not in v1.

## 13. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| AI model hallucination in SAR content | Medium | High | Human review mandatory before submission; XAI attribution; confidence scores; citations required |
| FINTRAC API changes breaking submission | Low | Critical | Abstraction layer over FINTRAC API; automated contract tests; 72h rollback plan |
| Data breach / tenant data leakage | Low | Critical | RLS + workspace isolation + encryption + pen testing; SOC 2 compliance |
| OpenAI/Anthropic service outage | Medium | High | Multi-model fallback chains; circuit breakers; graceful degradation to human-only workflows |
| Regulatory rejection of AI-generated SARs | Low | High | Human must approve all AI-generated filings; AI content clearly attributed in audit trail |
| Canadian data residency breach | Very Low | Critical | RLS enforced at DB level; no data replication outside Canada without explicit opt-in; legal review of all subprocessors |
| Slow enterprise sales cycles | High | Medium | Product-led growth for Starter/Pro; enterprise proof-of-concept program; reference customer program |
